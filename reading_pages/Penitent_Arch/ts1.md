# Time Series Data Exploration

Comparing with traditional datasets, time series data has hidden time patterns, which creates a different fun experience in data exploration! Let's looks at some popular and practical methods.

## Explore Univariate Time Series

### About the Data

Our perfume sales data is a typical time series data. It's also a univariate time series data, meaning there is only 1 time dependent variable ("Daily_Sales" in this example). See the example below:

</p>

Here's the sales plot. As we can see, there is an obvious repeated up and down pattern in the data:

### Time Series Components

A time series sequence has multiple components:
* <b>Trend</b>: It indicates the overall direction of the time series sequence, such as upward, downward or no trend.
* <b>Seasonality</b>: It refers to the tendency of going up and down in a consistent frequency. It's repetitive and calendar related.
* <b>Cycle</b>: Similar to seasonality, it's also recurring but with inconsistent frequencies. It's less frequent than seasonality fluctuations, and the time span of a cyclical change can be longer than a seasonal change.
  * Cycle is not time dependent and can only be explained by exogenous variables.
* <b>Residuals</b>: It's the error component, random and doesn't systematicaly depend on the time. It's caused by the lack of info, or caused by random noise, and it's inrreducible.

To explore a time series sequence, we often start with <b>decomposition</b>, which is a process of decomposing the sequence to trend, seasonlity and residuals. There are 2 categories of decomposition:

* Additive Method `Y[t] = T[t] + S[t] + E[t]`
  * It assumes the time series value at time `t` is the sum of trend (`T`), seasonality (`S`) and residuals (`E`) at time `t`.
  * This model is usually applied when there is a time-dependent trend component but constant seasonality that has the same amplitude and frequency over time.
* Multiplicative Method `Y[t] = T[t] * S[t] * E[t]`
  * This model often used when there is non-constant seasonality.

Let's look at the decomposition of our sales data. This is the additive decomposition:

</p>

And this is the multiplicative decomposition, looks almost the same as additive method's output, right? But as marked below, the data scale in seasonality and residuals are different:

<b>Observations</b>:
* The seasonality repeats almost every 7.5 days, that's around 1 week.
* Since the seasonality is not constant along the time, this time series might be more suitable to use multiplication decomposition.
* The residuals tend to have larger fluctuations between April and July, or at the beginning of a new year or at the beginning of October, this insight might be useful in later feature enggineering for model forecasting.
