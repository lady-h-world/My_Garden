## Kats vs Greykite

Kats might be one of the worst open source libraries Lady H. had ever used, because of its poor user experience. At the same time, we can't say Kats is purely useless. But after living through all those detection experiments, Lady H. no longer thinks applying Kats to time series forecasting would be a good idea. So let's end the comparison between Kats and Greykite before going to the model forecasting topic.

* <b>Code Design</b>: Greykite has much better code design than Kats, which appears in its flexible and smooth user experience, decent visualization and clear code guidance. By comparison, Kats has bugs almost everywhere, weird visualization, incomplete and even incorrect coding documentation. Using Kats, is a headache. ðŸ˜“
* <b>Trend Detection</b>: [Kats trend detection][1] doesn't have attractive visualization and always gets a misleading warning in the output, but the algorithms used behind its trend detection are reasonable. [Greykite detects trend through trend changepoints][2], the output visualization looks fancy but sometimes confusing.
* <b>Changepoint Detection</b>: [Kats changepoint detection][3] may not works on every time series data, but it supports multiple algorithms for both local and global changepoints detection. [Greykite changepoint detection][4] supports both trend and seasonality changepoints detection, but the visualization as well as the detected changepoints can be confusing.
* <b>Outlier Detection</b>: [Kats outlier detection][5] delivers reasonable results on univariate time series, but for multivariate time series outlier detection, [using Lady H.'s DIY methods is a better choice][7]! [Greykite outlier detection][6] is not built upon a reasonable foundation.
* <b>Seasonality Detection</b>: [Kats seasonality detection][8] has improved visualization (comparing with its other visualizayion) but lack of insightful output, its output of the seasonality length is a benefit though. [Greykite seasonality detection][9] provides a flexible way to explore different seasonality cycels, the visualization output is also insightful.

Between Kats and Greykite, which one do you prefer in time series work? Or if you have any other recommendations, [welcome to share ideas here!][10]
