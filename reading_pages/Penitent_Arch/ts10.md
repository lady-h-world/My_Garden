### Greykite Changepoint Detection
Greykite changepoint detection includes both trend and seasonality changepoints detection. The trend changepoint detection is similar to Kats trend detection. To detect changepoints, Greykite will preprocess the time series with mean aggregation to avoid trend picks up small fluctuations or seasonality effects, then it places a great number of changepoints uniformly over the whole time span. Next, to remove those insignificant changepoints, it applies adaptive lasso to shrink their coefficients to 0. Finally, it also does a post filtering to eliminate changepoints that are too close.

Remember that in Kats changepoint detection, Lady H. simply could not make it work on the sales data? With Greykite, the changepoint detection works on all the 3 time series (sales, temperature and humidity data).


#### Trend Changepoint Detection
The configuration for trend detection is shown as below, no matter it's univariate time series or multivariate time series input, you just need to specify the time series variable name.

The plot of changepoints allows more info to be added, such as trend line, seasonality, etc. The example below shows the trend changepoints on the sales data:

</p>

These are the trend changepoints for humidity and temperature data:

</p>

However we don't know the detected changepoints here indicate increasing trend or decreasing trend.

#### Seasonality Changepoint Detection

The configuration for seasonality changepoint detection is similar to Greykite trend detection, but just to change to another function:

</p>

Greykite will show seasonality changepoints for different components (daily, weekly, yearly). For example, for the sales data, it has detected weekly and yearly changepoints:

<p align="left">
<img src="https://github.com/lady-h-world/My_Garden/blob/main/images/Garden_Totem_images/detection/gk_seasaonlity_cp1.png" width="1200" height="360" />
</p>

These are the seasonality changepoints for humidity and temperature data:

<p align="left">
<img src="https://github.com/lady-h-world/My_Garden/blob/main/images/Garden_Totem_images/detection/gk_seasonality_cp2.png" width="1200" height="360" />
</p>

<img src="https://github.com/lady-h-world/My_Garden/blob/main/images/Garden_Totem_images/detection/gk_seasonality_cp3.png" width="1200" height="360" />
</p>

But some items in the plot can be confusing. Such as, why the trend line can be much higher than the whole time series? Why there can be yearly changepoint while the overall time series is less than 1 year length? Comparing with [Kats changepoint detection][3], which output makes more sense to you?
