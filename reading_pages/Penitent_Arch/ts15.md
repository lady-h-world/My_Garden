In this ARIMA diagnostic plot:
1. We check the residual plot to see whether it's random, otherwise it means the model needs improvement as it left some time series patterns unexplained.
2. By comparing the orange KDE curve and the green standard normal distribution curve, the larger overlap the 2 curves have, the better model is.
3. Looking at the blue scatter plot and the red line in Q-Q plot, more overlap indicates a better model performance.
4. In correlogram, except lag 0, if we see any significant lag, it means there's seasonality left unexplained by the model. In this case, we are seeing lag 7 has the most significant bar, this also aligns with the 1 week seasonality found in [decomposed time series observation][2] and [Kats ACF seasonality detector][1].

To consider seasonality in the model, we can use `SARIMA`, it adds a seasonality parameter `m` in the ARIMA model.

Now let's add `m=7` in SARIMA while using `(p=10, d=0, q=0)` as an example. Note, using `p=10` is not conflict with what we just found that `p=7` is more ideal, this is just an example, check "Step 3" below for more.

As we can see in the fitted model output below, AIC, BIC, HQIC all became worse:

The diagnostic plot also looks worse:

However, we got better forecasting performance as MAPE decreased from 4.46 to 1.15 and R2 increased from 0.11 to 0.54.

Seeing such conflicting training and testing performance results, how to assign better parameters became uncertain. Is there a better way to find the parameter values that can further improve model performance?


### Step 3: (S)ARIMA Hyperparameter Tuning (HPO)
Lady H. employs grid search to tune the parameters of (S)ARIMA models for improved performance. Typically, the parameter search space is not extensive, so tuning (S)ARIMA models does not require a significant amount of time.

The grid search code is shown below. It iterates through each parameter set and selects the one that achieves the best validation performance, using MAPE as the performance metric. The results align with the findings in Step 2, where `p=7` appears to deliver better model performance than `p=10`.

</p>

`(p=7, d=0, q=0, m=7)`is the selected parameter set. The optimized model gets better MAPE but worse R2:

Here's the forecasting performance comparison between manually assigned ARIMA, manually assigned SARIMA and HPO tuned SARIMA.

</p>

You might be wondering why Lady H. doesn't use [python built-in auto arima][7]. She did, but got much worse results, especially after adding the seasonality parameter `m`. [Check Lady H.'s failed experiment here][6].

However, the best result we've seen so far is still not satisfactory. Is there a way to significantly improve both MAPE and RÂ²? Lady H. always has a better solution! Can you guess what's coming next? ðŸ˜‰
