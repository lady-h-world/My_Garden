In this ARIMA diagnostic plot:
1. We check the residual plot to see whether it's random, otherwise it means the model needs improve since it left some time series patterns unexplained.
2. By comparing the orange KDE curve and the green standard normal distribution curve, the larger overlap the 2 curves have, the better model is.
3. Looking at the blue scatter plot and the red line in Q-Q plot, more overlap indicates a better model performance.
4. In correlogram, except lag 0, if we see any significant lag, it means there's seasonality left unexplained by the model. In this case, we are seeing lag 7 has the most significant bar, this also aligns with the 1 week seasonality found in [decomposed time series observation][2] and [Kats ACF seasonality detector][1].

To consider seasonality in the model, we can use `SARIMA`, it adds a seasonality parameter `m` in the ARIMA model.

Now let's add `m=7` in SARIMA while keeping `p, d, q` value the same as the ARIMA model. As we can see in the fitted model output below, AIC, BIC, HQIC all became worse:

The diagnostic plot also looks worse:

</p>

However, we got better forecasting performance as MAPE decreased from 4.46 to 1.15 and R2 increased from 0.11 to 0.54.

Seeing such conflicting training and testing performance results, how to assign better parameters became uncertain. Is there a better way to find the parameter values that can further improve model performance?


### Step 3: (S)ARIMA Hyperparameter Tuning (HPO)

Lady H. will use grid search to tune (S)ARIMA parameters in order to achieve better model performance. Often times, there won't be a large number parameters to choose, so it won't take very long time to tune (S)ARIMA models.

As we said in Step 2, `p=7` might get better model performance than `p=10`. `p=14` also shows higher autocorrelation in PACF than `p=10`, let's try them too. From the diagnostic plot of SARIMA above, we are seeing there is seasonality left at lag 9, so let's add `season_order=9` in the parameter sets. The grid search code looks as below, it goes through each parameter set and finally chooses the one that gave best validation performance. Here, MAPE is used as the performance metrics.

</p>

`(p=7, d=0, q=0, m=7)`is the selected parameter set. The optimized model gets better MAPE but worse R2:

Here's the forecasting performance comparison between manually assigned ARIMA, manually assigned SARIMA and HPO tuned SARIMA.

</p>

You might be wondering why Lady H. doesn't use [python built-in auto arima][7]. She did, but got much worse results, especially after adding the seasonality parameter `m`. [Check Lady H.'s failed experiment here][6].

But the best result we are seeing so far is still not good enough. Is there any way to boost both MAPE and R2 significantly? Lady H. always has a better solution! Guess what's next? ðŸ˜‰
