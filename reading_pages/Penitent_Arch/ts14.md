# Time Series Model Forecasting
Applying deep learning or machine learning models to time series data is relatively straightforward. However, there are specialized models and tools specifically designed for time series forecasting. Unfortunately, online tutorials often provide incomplete or even misleading guidance, and the promotion of these tools is uncommon. To address this, Lady H. decided to showcase the capability of methods dedicated to time series analysis.


## Statistical Time Series Forecasting - (S)ARIMA
When it comes to time series forecasting, "ARIMA" is a popular method people often talk about, especially during data science interviews. But how many interviewees and even interviewers really used ARIMA in the work, and used well?

Many online tutorials can be misleading, either by omitting crucial information or including unnecessarily complex details. Moreover, they often rely on [Air Passenger data as an example][1], which is too simplistic to reflect real-world challenges. In reality, the performance of a time series forecasting method can vary significantly depending on the dataset.

To address this, Lady H. decided to share the ARIMA process she frequently uses, which has proven to be reliable across various time series problems. The following experiments will use daily sales data as the input:

### Step 1: Data Exploration
Before applying ARIMA, we can plot ACF and PACF of the data first.

* ACF: It is the autocorrelation plot. 
  * Autocorrelation reflects the degree of linear dependency between `ith` and `(i+g)th` (`g` is the lag) time series. Autocorrelation is a value between `[-1, 1]`. A positive autocorrelation suggests that the values tend to move in the same direction, a negative autocorrelation implies they move in opposite directions, and a value close to 0 indicates minimal or no temporal dependency.
  * In an ACF plot, each vertical bar represents the degree of linear dependency between the `ith` time point and the `(i+g)th` time point, referred to as 'autocorrelation.' Given a confidence level (such as 95%), any autocorrelation value outside the confidence interval (indicated by the threshold lines) is considered significant.

* PACF: It is the partial autocorrelation plot. In ACF, the autocorrelation between `ith` time series and `(i+g)th` time series can be affected by `(i+1)th, (i+2)th, ..., (i+g-1)th` time series too, so PACF removes the influence from these intermediate time series and only checks the autocorrelation between `ith` and `(i+g)th` time series.
  * Lag0 always has autocorrelation as 1.

Here're the ACF and PACF plots for our daily sales data:

### Step 2: Estimate ARIMA Parameters

The main reason of checking ACF and PACF plots is to help estimate the parameters of ARIMA. 
* `ARIMA(p, d, q)`
  * `p` is the order of AR (auto regression) model. AR model makes the prediction based on prior time values, therefore to decide `p`, we often check PACF to find which lag indicates significant partial auto correlation, and use that lag value as the value of `p`.
  * `q` is the order of MA (moving average) model. MA model uses the autocorrelation between residuals to forecast values. We often check ACF to find the value of `q`.
  * `d` is the order of differencing needed to convert the time series to stationary.

</p>

Thumb rules for choose ARIMA parameter values:
* If ACF is exponentially decreasing or forming a sine-wave, and PACF has significant autocorrelation, then use p
* If ACF has significant autocorrelation and PACF has exponential decay or sine-wave pattern, then use q
* If both ACF, PACF are showing sine-waves, then use both p, q

Let's manually assign ARIMA parameters first. Although ACF and PACF are more complex than the thumb rules situations, we can start with using `p`. Meanwhile, when checking PACF, there are several lags showing significant autocorrelation. Lady H. tried `p` between 7 and 10 and found `p=7` got better AIC, BIC performance. The detail is shown as below:

</p>

1. Section 1 is showing the code of fitting ARIMA with manually chosen parameters
2. Section 2 is showing the training performance using AIC, BIC and HQIC
3. Section 3 indicates choosing `p=7` might get a better performance than using `p=10`, as PACF shows the highest autocorrelation appears at lag 7 and the fitted ARIMA model shows the highest absolute coefficient and the lowest standard error

</p>

The comparision between forecatsed values and the real testing data is shown below, there is not much overlap between the green curve and the orange curve. We are using both MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) and R2 as the evaluation metrics, getting 4.46 MAPE and 0.11 R2, neither is a satisfying metric. We need to improve.
