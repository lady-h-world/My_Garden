# Time Series Model Forecasting

It is straightforward to apply deep learning or classical machine learning models on time series data. At the same time, there are models and tools designed for time series forecasting specifically, but online tutorials often only contain partial information or even misleading guidance, the promotion of promising tools is not common either. Therefore, Lady H. decided to show the super power from time series dedicated methods.

## Statistical Time Series Forecasting - (S)ARIMA

When it comes to time series forecasting, "ARIMA" is a popular method people often talk about, especially during data science interviews. But how many interviewees and even interviewers really used ARIMA in the work, and used well?

Many online tutorials are misleading, either because they are missing important knowledge or contain distracting complex information. What's more, they always choose [Air Passenger data as an example][1], which is too simple to represent real world problems. One of the realities of time series forecasting is, same method applied to different datasets can lead to quite different model performance. 

So, Lady H. decided to show the ARIMA process she often applied that had been proved to be reliable on multiple time series problems. The data input demoed here will be our daily sales data:

### Step 1: Data Exploration

Before applying ARIMA, we can plot ACF and PACF of the data first.

* ACF: It is the autocorrelation plot. 
  * Autocorrelation reflects the degree of linear dependency between ith and (i+h)th (h is the lag) time series. Autocorrelation is a value between `[-1, 1]`. Positive autocorrelation means the two time series moves towards the same direction and negative means opposite directions, 0 autocorrelation means the temporal dependency is hard to find.
  * In ACF plot, each vertical bar indicates the autocorrelation between ith time series and (i+h)th time series. Given a confidence level (such as 95%), when the bar is out of the confidence interval (the threshold lines), the autocorrelation is significant.

* PACF: It is the partial autocorrelation plot. In ACF, the autocorrelation between ith time series and (i+h)th time series can be affected by (i+1)th, (i+2)th, ..., (i+h-1)th time series too, so PACF removes the influence from these intermediate time series and only checks the autocorrelation between ith and (i+h)th time series.
  * Lag0 always has autocorrelation as 1.

Here're the ACF and PACF plots for our daily sales data:

### Step 2: Estimate ARIMA Parameters

The main reason of checking ACF and PACF plots is to help estimate the parameters of ARIMA. 
* `ARIMA(p, d, q)`
  * `p` is the order of AR (auto regression) model. AR model makes the prediction based on prior time values, therefore to decide p, we often check PACF to find which lag indicates significant partial auto correlation, and use that lag value as the value of `p`.
  * `q` is the order of MA (moving average) model. MA model uses the autocorrealtion between residuals to forecast values. We often check ACF to find the value of `q`.
  * `d` is the order of differencing needed to convert the time series to stationary.

</p>

Thumb rules for choose ARIMA parameter values:
* If ACF is exponentially decreasing or forming a sine-wave, and PACF has significant autocorrelation, then use p
* If ACF has significant autocorrelation and PACF has exponential decay or sine-wave pattern, then use q
* If both ACF, PACF are showing sine-waves, then use both p, q

Let's manually assign ARIMA parameters first. Although ACF and PACF are more complex than the thumb rules situations, we can start with using `p`. Meanwhile, when checking PACF, there are several lags showing significant autocorrelation. Lady H. tried `p` between 7 and 10 and found `p=10` got better AIC, BIC performance. The detail is shown as below:

</p>

1. Section 1 is showing the code of fitting ARIMA with manually chosen parameters
2. Section 2 is showing the training performance using AIC, BIC and HQIC
3. Section 3 indicates choosing `p=7` might get a better performance than using `p=10`, as PACF shows the highest autocorrelation appears at lag 7 and the fitted ARIMA model shows the highest absolute coefficient and the lowest standard error

</p>

The comparision between forecatsed values and the real testing data is shown below, there is not much overlap between the green curve and the orange curve. We are using both MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) and R2 as the evaluation metrics, getting 4.46 MAPE and 0.11 R2, neither is a satisfying metric.
