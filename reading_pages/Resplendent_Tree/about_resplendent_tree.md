Have you ever seen a tree has different colored flowers bloom at the same time? 

Look at there! Near the lively waterfall! See that colorful tree!? The Surrounding butterflies made it more radiant. That's our Resplendent Tree!

Every flower on this tree has 5 petals. Lady H. used to joke, if you can find a 6-petal flower on this tree, that day must be your lucky day! The flowers have 5 color breeds, they are orange, yellow, pink, purple and blue. Each breed has different shades, such as rose pink and light pink, dark blue and light blue, etc. Flowers from the same breed often grow closer to each other, however, if one breed gets sick, soon all the other breeds will wither too, they prosper and fade together.

Each breed has a unique strength. Pink flowers provides stunning fragrance that can't be found anywhere else, it's one of the secret ingredients in our garden perfumes ðŸ˜‰! Blue flowers can be used in medicine to cure a wide variety of diseases, such as cancer, HIV, dementia, etc. Yellow flowers have natural sweetness, it can replace sugar for a healthy diet. Orange flowers can glow at night, and in summer, one of our popular activities is to walk around the garden at night while having a glowing orange flower at hand, together with other bright creatures in the garden, it's an extraordinary beauty. Dried purple flowers brings peace to mind, Lady H. often puts lots of them in her bedroom to get a good sleep.
  
Lady H. told us, in the outside world, human beings have different skin colors, their existence is smilar to the flowers on this tree. Same colored people are easier to get closer. Each skin color group has its unique beauty and culture, but all the groups prosper together and fall together.
