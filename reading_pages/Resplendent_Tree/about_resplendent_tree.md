Look over there, by the waterfall! Do you see that vibrant tree? The butterflies fluttering around it make it shine even brighter. That, my friend, is the Resplendent Tree!

Its flowers bloom in five striking colors: orange, yellow, pink, purple, and blue. Each color comes in various shades—like rose pink and soft pink, or deep blue and sky blue. Flowers of the same kind tend to cluster together, but they are all interconnected. If one group falls ill, the rest will soon wither as well. They thrive or fade together, sharing the same fate.

Every flower has a unique gift. The pink blooms release a fragrance found nowhere else in the world, a vital secret in our garden’s perfumes 😉. The blue flowers possess remarkable healing properties, effective against ailments ranging from cancer and HIV to dementia—and even the lust for conquest. Yellow flowers are naturally sweet and make a perfect, healthy alternative to sugar. Orange flowers glow in the dark, and during summer, one of our most beloved activities is a nighttime walk through the garden, carrying a glowing orange bloom. With other bioluminescent creatures around, it becomes a magical experience like no other. As for the purple flowers, they bring tranquility to the mind. Lady H. always keeps plenty of dried purple petals in her bedroom to ensure a peaceful, restful sleep.
  
Lady H. once told us that, in the outside world, people come in many different skin tones, just like the flowers on this tree. Those with similar colors often find it easier to bond. Each group has its own unique beauty and culture, but just like the flowers, they flourish together and face life’s challenges as one.
