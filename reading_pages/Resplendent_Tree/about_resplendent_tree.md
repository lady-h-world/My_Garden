Have you ever seen a tree with various colored flowers blooming simultaneously? 

Right there, near the waterfall! Do you see that vibrant tree? The surrounding butterflies enhanced its radiance. That's our Resplendent Tree!

Each flower on this tree has precisely five petals. Lady H. used to joke, saying that if you ever find a 6-petal flower on this tree, that day must be your lucky day! The flowers come in five color variations: orange, yellow, pink, purple, and blue. Each color breed exhibits various shades, such as rose pink and light pink, dark blue and light blue, etc. Flowers from the same breed often cluster together. However, if one breed got sick, soon all the other breeds will wither too, they prosper and fade in unison.

Each breed has a unique strength. Pink flowers offer a stunning fragrance that is exclusive to our garden and serves as one of the secret ingredients in our perfumes 😉! Blue flowers have medicinal properties and can be used to treat a diverse range of diseases, such as cancer, HIV, dementia, the lust of conquest, etc. Yellow flowers naturally contain sweetness, making them a healthy alternative to sugar in one's diet. Orange flowers have the special ability to glow at night. During summer, one of our popular activities is strolling through the garden at night, holding a glowing orange flower, surrounded by other luminous creatures, creating an extraordinary spectacle. Dried purple flowers brings peace to mind, Lady H. often places plenty of them in her bedroom to ensure a sound sleep.
  
Lady H. told us that in the outside world, human beings have various skin colors, much like the flowers on this tree. Same colored people often find it easier to connect. Each skin color group has its unique beauty and culture, but all the groups thrive together and face challenges together.
