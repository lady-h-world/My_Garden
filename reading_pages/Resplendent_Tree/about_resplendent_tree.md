Have you ever seen a tree has different colors of flowers bloom at the same time? 

Look at there! Near the lively waterfall! See that colorful tree!? The Surrounding butterflies made it more radiant. That's our Resplendent Tree!

Every flower has 5 petals, and Lady H. used to joke, if you can find a 6-petal flower on this tree, that day must be your lucky day! The flowers have 5 color breeds, they are orange, yellow, pink, purple and blue. Each breed has different form and shades of flowers, such as rose pink and light pink, dark blue and light blue, etc. Flowers from the same breed often grow closer to each other, however, if one breed gets sick all the other breeds will wither soon too, they prosper and fade together.

Each breed has a unique strength. Pink flowers provides stunning scent in perfume, it's one of the secret ingredients in our garden made perfumes ðŸ˜‰! Blue flowers can be used in medicine and it can cure a wide variety of disease. Yellow flowers has natural sweetness, which can be added in food to replace sugar and provide healthy diet. Orange flowers can glow at night, and in summer, one of our popular activities is to walk around the garden at night while having a glowing orange flower at hand, together with other bright creatures in the garden, it's a stunning beauty. Dried purple flowers brings the peace of mind, Lady H. often puts lots of them in her bedroom to get a good sleep.
