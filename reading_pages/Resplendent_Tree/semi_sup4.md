#### Performance with Different Mask Rate

All the experiments above were using 90% masked data. What does the performance look like with different mask rates? Lady H. applied both DIY solution and built-in `ElkanotoPuClassifier` solution on datasets with 95%, 80%, 50%, 30% mask rates. It turned out DIY solution is a better option because it has slightly better performance on 95% masked data and similar performance on other datasets.

This is the performance comparison on 95% masked data.
