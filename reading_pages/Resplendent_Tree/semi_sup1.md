## Semi-Supervised Learning

So far you have seen the power of supervised and unsupervised learning. Have you veer wonder whether there's anything in between? 

Semi-supervised learning is! It's trying to solve problems with a combination of labeled data and unlabeled data.


### About the Data

The raw data is the same as the [source data in correlation section][1]. To get partially labeled data, we need to mask the data. In real world, 2 types of scenario often appear:
1. Each class has labeled and unlabeled data.
2. Only 1 class is partially labeled and all the other data is unlabeled.

So, we will create both types of data masking. Our data has 2 classes.

#### Type 1 Mask

In the first type of masking, we mask some data in both classes as unlabeled, and allow flexible settings on unlabeled data percentage.

The original labeled data still keep their 0 or 1 labels, and the unlabeled data will be marked as -1. If we apply stratified split to get train & test data, the percentage of each data label in training data stays the same in testing data. In the example below, we have masked 95% data:

If we apply UMAP dimensional reduction to reduce the dataset into 2 dimensions, coloring the data point based on their masks and real labels ("0False" means masked negative class, "0True" means original negative class, "1False" means masked positive class, "1True" means original positive class), let's look at the plot of training data:

and the plot of testing data:

Can't find any pattern to differentiate classes well, right? Cool! With this type of data, we will try to classify all the masked data.
