## Correlation

You must had been reminded many times that "correlation is not causation", still people like to check correlations. Sometimes it's because a certain algorithm has made an assumption that there's almost no correlation in the data, such as linear regression; sometimes it helps remove unnecessary features in algorithms, such as tree models, as these algorithms won't be affected by correlation; sometimes people just want to observe the relationship between variables.

Correlation is not limited within numerical variables, it can happen between categorical variables as well, and in fact it can happen between numerical and categorical variables too.
