We have a bank in the garden. For us garden residents, we make lots of money but don't spend a lot, saving it in our bank is a good choice since it often teaches us how to spend money and live a happy life. For example, we get monthly newsletter of tourism spots in the universe, where we can spend a great vacation and experience different culture; sometimes we get donation opportunities to help people in need from the outside world, because each time there're only 2 ~ 5 randomly selected people can donate, we all actively participate and feeling lucky if we got selected to donate ðŸ˜„!
  
People from the outside of the world also save their money in our bank because of its security and attractive investment opportunities. Every month, our bank will launch a campaign to recommend some bank products to customers who are most likely need them. For example, this month the bank just launched a saving product campaign. Before launching this campaign, it will collect customers' profile to predict whether they will deposit more money, and the campaign will target those who got higher prediction score.

And this piece of data will be used to show the power of correlation and semi-supervised learning as well ðŸ˜‰!


## Correlation

You must had been reminded many times that "correlation is not causation", still people like to check correlations. Sometimes it's because a certain algorithm has made an assumption that there's almost no correlation in the data, such as linear regression; sometimes it helps remove unnecessary features in algorithms, such as tree models, as these algorithms won't be affected by correlation; sometimes people just want to observe the relationship between variables.

Correlation is not limited within numerical variables, it can happen between categorical variables as well, and in fact it can happen between numerical and categorical variables too.
