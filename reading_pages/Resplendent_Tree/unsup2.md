### Finding Optimal K

There are many online data science tutorials in your world, but how many of them can be helpful in real world work? Lady H. never fully trust those tutorials, so when she found something interesting, she will dive deeper into the theories behind and do experiments using different datasets. The idea of this experiment started from an article called ["Are You Still Using the Elbow Method?"][1]. In this article, the author compared several methods used to find the optimal number of clusters, using 5 datasets with 2 to 25 clusters. The visualization is very persuasive and he concluded that elbow method, a popular k-finding method performed worst.
