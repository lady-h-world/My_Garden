## Clustering - Finding Optimal K

As most of you know, clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique, it groups data without any data label. A popular topic in clustering is to decide `k`, the number of clusters. Now we are going to explore different methods that helps decide the optimal value of k.


### About the Data

So far, all the data you have seen were delivered by [Crystal Ball][1] through searches in the universe ðŸ˜‰. It can also generate data from its own to mimic real world scenarios, and we call this process as "data simulation". With data simulation, we can experiment on more kinds of data conditions. The clustering data here is simulated data.
