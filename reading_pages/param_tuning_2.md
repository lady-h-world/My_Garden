The performance of FLAML and Optuna in Table 1.1 came from their best experiment results. In order to give you a better view of the power of our sprouts, we'd like to take you around to see the internal mechanism, as well as each experiment's details.

### Design Overview - FLAML

The overall design of FLAML is shown in Figure 1.2:

<p align="center">

</p>

It has 2 major components:
* ML Layer contains the candidate learners.
* AutoML Layer includes a Resampling Strategy Proposer, a Learner Proposer, a Hyperparam & Sample Size Proposer and a Controller. This component controls the core logic of search strategy, with the goal of minimizing the total cost before finding a model with the lowest test error.
  * "Total Cost" means the total GPU time of training and validation using cross validation or holdout. This cost is also expected to increase as the test error decreases.

</p>

Now let's look into each step:

<b>Step 0 - Resampling Strategy</b>: It's a simple thresholding rule to choose between cross validation or holdout. According to FLAML researchers, cross validation is preferred over holdout for small sample size or large time budget.
* "Time Budget" means the total amount of time the user allows FLAML to run HPO.

<b>Step 1 - Learner Proposer</b>: A learner gets a higher priority if it makes improvement with less estimated cost. Meanwhile, every learner has a chance to be searched again since the estimation can be impresise.

<b>Step 2 - Hyperparam & Sample Size Proposer</b>: In this step, each learner chooses between increasing the sample size or trying out a new parameter set in order to make the improvement. By default, each new parameter set is searched by a randomized direct search strategy, CFO. We will show you more about it soon.

<b>Step 3 - Controller</b>: The controller will invoke the trial using the selected learner and observe both validation error as well as GPU time cost of the trial.

Step 1 ~ 3 are repeated by iterations until running out of the time budget.

### Design Overview - Optuna

The overall design of Optuna is shown in Figure 1.3:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/lady-h-world/My_Garden/blob/main/images/The_Queen_images/optuna_design.png" width="678" height="424" />
</p>

Optuna introduced define-by-run framework into HPO in 2019. The main idea behind define-by-run is, a user only needs to suggest the value range of each hyperparameter and optuna will decide the hyperparamster's value in each trial based on historical evaluated trials' results. Because of this framework design, optuna is able to provide highly modular programming that a user-defined objective function receives a living trial as input and evaluates the trial result. This also enables the parallel computation of multiple trials.

</p>

Optuna's sampling methods work as its search strategy, which support both independent sampling (such as TPE) and relational sampling (such as CMA-ES). Independent sampling samples hyperparameters independently while relational sampling exploits the correlations between hyperparaemters. To achieve cost-effectiveness, optuna also provides pruning algorithm to terminate unpromising trials based on periodically monitored intermediate objective values.

As we can see in Figure 1.3, each optuna worker executes an instance of the objective function as well as sampling algorithm and pruning algorithm of a study. This type of design is suitable for distributed environment where workers are running in parallel. However, workers are sharing the progress of current study via the storage. An objective function can also access the storage to get the information of past studies.

Table 1.2 has compared and summarized the design of FLAML and Optuna:

While sharing several common strengths, FLAML is designed to be more automated in optimization. The main difference in their core algorithms is FLAML makes decisions based on the estimated evaluation while Optuna is based on historical evaluation.
