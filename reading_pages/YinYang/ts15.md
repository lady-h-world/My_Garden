In this ARIMA diagnostic plot:
1. We check the residual plot to see whether it's random, otherwise it means the model has left time series patterns unexplained.
2. By comparing the orange KDE cureve and the green standard normal distribution curve, the larger overlap the 2 curves have, the better model is.
3. Looking at the blue scatter plot and the red line in Q-Q plot, more overlap indicates a better model performance.
4. In correlogram, except lag 0, if we see any significant lag, it means there's seasonality left. In this case, we are seeing lag 7 has the most significant bar, this also aligns with [our decomposed time series observation][2] and the seasoanlity detected in [Kats ACF seasonality detector][1].

To consider seasonality in the model, we can use `SARIMA`, it adds a seasonality parameter `m` in the ARIMA model.

Now let's add `m=7` in SARIMA while keeping `p, d, q` value the same as the ARIMA model. As we can see in the fitted model output below, AIC, BIC, HQIC all became worse:

The diagnostic plot also looks worse:

However, we got better forecasting performance as MAPE decreased from 4.46 to 1.15 and R2 increased from 0.11 to 0.54.

Seeing such conflicting training and testing performance results, how to assign better parameters became uncertain. Is there a better way to find the parameter values that can further improve model performance?


### Step 3: (S)ARIMA Hyperparameter Tuning (HPO)

Lady H. will use grid search to tune (S)ARIMA parameters in order to achieve better model performance. Often times, there won't be a large number parameters to choose, so it won't take very long time to turn (S)ARIMA models.

As we said in Step 2, `p=7` might get better model performance than `p=10`. `p=14` also shows higher autocorrelation in PACF than `p=10`, let try it too. From the diagnostic plot of SARIMA above, we are seeing there is seasaonlity left at lag 9, so let add `m=9` in the parameter sets. The grid search code looks as below, it go through each parameter set and finally choose the one that gave best validation performance. Here, MAPE is used as the performance metrics.

`(p=7, d=0, q=0, m=7)`is the selected parameter set. The optimized model gets better MAPE but worse R2:

🌻 [Check details of HPO SARIMA >>][3]

Here's the forecasting performance comparison between manually assigned ARIMA, manually assigned SARIMA and HPO tuned SARIMA.

Is there anyway to improve the model perforamnce in a more significant way?
