## Seasonality Detection

Different from data points detection, seasonality detection is to find seasonality pattern in the time series. In [time series decomposition][1], the disclosed seasonality pattern is one of the solutions. In this section, you will see more methods in displaying seasonality patterns.

### Kats Seasonality Detection

Kats has 2 main seasoanlity detection methods. ACF (autocorrelation function) Detector and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Detector.

#### ACF Seasonality Detector

The data input is sales data. Kats' ACF seasonality detection is as simple as the ACF plot below. Besides, it outputs whether there is seasonality and seasaonlity length (7 days in this case).

</p>

ACF is often used in ARIMA when people want to decide the parameter values. In ACF plot, each vertical bar indicates the degree of linear dependency between ith time point and i+gth time point, also known as "autocorrelation". Given a confidence level (such as 95%), out of the confidence interval (the threshold lines), the autocorrelation is significant.

Positive autocorrelation indicates moving towards the same direction, negative value indicates moving towards the opposite direction, 0 means the temporal dependencies is hard to find. As shown in the plot above, we are seeing repeated changes between significant positive autocorrelation and significant negative autocorrelation, which also indicates the seasoanlity in this time series.

#### FFT Seasonality Detector

FTT (Fast Fourier Transform) takes a time-based data, measures every repetitive pattern and returns the amplitude, offset and rotation speed in each repetitive sequence.

If we use sales data as an example, FFT detected seasonality pattern is shown with the purple curve below. [Kats uses frequency and amplitude as the detection output][3]. You can consider the output is like a signal wave, therefore the y-axis "PSD(dB)" indicates the signal power per unit bandwidth. For x-axis, if the time series is daily basis, then it will be "1/Day", hourly basis will be "1/Hour". The detected seasonality has length as 6.98 days, quite close to the 7 days detected by ACF seasonality detector.

At the same time, you might noticed the detected outliers in the plot too, which are marked with purple dots. Outlier detection also based on FFT. It calculates an amplitude threshold using `amplitude median + amplitude mean absolute deviation * mad_threshold`, "mad_threshold" is a positve numerical user aassigned mean absolute deviation threshold (larger value, less sensitive to outliers). The outliers are non-harmonics data points with their amplitude passed threshold. [Explore detailed logic here!][4]

Similarly, we can plot FFT detected humiditity seasoanlity:

And FFT detected temperature seasaonlity:

### Greykite Seasonality Detection

Greykite seasonality detection provides lots of informative visualization and insights (maybe too much...). It supports different seasonality cycles, such as yearly, monthly, quarterly, weekly, daily. Within each seasonality cycle, there are different time features to explore, for example, in yearly seasonality, there is day of year seasonality, day of month seasonality, etc.

Let's take a look at sales data's yearly seasonality by day of month. There are 2 patterns shown in this plot:
* The peak and trough sales in 2013 and 2014 appear to be opposite to each other
* The sales peak and trough in 2016 tends to happen earlier than same periods of 2013, 2014

Besides seeing the seasonality pattern in each year, we can also plot average sales throughout the time, as we can see below, this mean value changes over the time, which poses challenges to find seasaonlity changepoints.

<p align="left">

</p>

Therefore, Greykite provides "relative offset" plot which removes the effect caused by changing mean. Look at the relative offset plot below, the 2 patterns found above became more clear, besides, we can see in 2013, 2014, between August and October, the sales fluctuation is becoming smaller, so August and October can be considered as seasonality changepoints.

</p>

We can also explore monthly sales patterns by day of week. It seems that every month is showing similar patterns that Monday tends to have a bit higher sales while Sunday has 0 sales because all the stores are closed.

<p align="left">

</p>

Similarly, we can plot day of week sales patterns by month, which can disclose weekly seasonality in all years. The sales patterns on Monday and Sunday are still quite different from other days of week.

<p align="left">
<img src="https://github.com/lady-h-world/My_Garden/blob/main/images/Garden_Totem_images/detection/gk_s10.png" width="1000" height="212" />
</p>

But are you going to wonder whether every week in a month, we will see the same pretty patterns above? Let's look at day of week patterns by day of month. Ah! It seems that Monday doesn't lead sales every week, especailly around 10th or 20th days in a month, Monday sales can be lower than other days of week.

<p align="left">
<img src="https://github.com/lady-h-world/My_Garden/blob/main/images/Garden_Totem_images/detection/gk_s14.png" width="1000" height="214" />
</p>

Greykite also allows you to check seasonality patterns in customized periods. For example, Lady H. was wondering whether the new year week has quite different sales pattern than other period. So she divided the time as new year week and other period:

<p align="left">
<img src="https://github.com/lady-h-world/My_Garden/blob/main/images/Garden_Totem_images/detection/gk_s_newyear.png" width="504" height="676" />
</p>

Then looking at weekly seasonality in both periods, the week of new year is indeed showing quite different sales patterns:

<p align="left">
<img src="https://github.com/lady-h-world/My_Garden/blob/main/images/Garden_Totem_images/detection/gk_s9.png" width="1000" height="212" />
</p>

You can also randomly choose multiple periods and plot their sales patterns to get some general ideas. For example, here Lady H. chose 20 weeks sales patterns randomly, most of the weeks are showing similar patterns but the week of 2015-05-31 is a special one, its Friday sales was much lower than average while its other weekdays' sales were much higher than the average. From there, we can dive deeper to understand more.
