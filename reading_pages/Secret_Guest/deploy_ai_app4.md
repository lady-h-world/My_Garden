### Build Results Page

The code below has the key logic of recommendation generation and map display.
* `get_llm_suggests()` uses OpenAI to suggest traveling locations in your destination and local activities in each location.
* `get_geo_json()` uses Nominatim, a geocoding software to find the latitude and longitude of each suggested location.
* `get_map()` will create a map based on locations' latitude and longitude, then Streamlit built-in `pydeck_chart()` will display the map.
