### Why Synthetic Data?

Before we dive into how to generate synthetic data, have you ever thought about, why do we need synthetic data?

You will get a long list of answers if asking ChatGPT. Lady H. summarized a few situations based on her experience:
* Data Sharing: Synthetic data can be shared with other teams when data privacy is a concern but those teams require realistic data to perform their tasks.
* Testing: To assess the quality or efficiency of a product, real data might have incomplete test cases or limited data size. By using synthetic data you can generate additional test cases to ensure the product quality, you can also create datasets of various sizes to conduct load tests on the product.
* Data Augmentation: Computer vision often employees this method, by using synthetic data it increases the diversity of training data, with the aim to enhance model performance.

Any other use cases can't be covered by these 3 categories? You're very welcome to share your ideas [here][1]!
