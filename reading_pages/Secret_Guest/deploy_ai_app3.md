### Build Home Page

Every page in Streamlit has 2 components:
* The side bar on the left. 
  * Streamlit will automatically detect all of your web pages and list them on the side bar.
  * You can decide which elements to show on the side var, such as the logo, required user input, etc.
* The main web elements on the right.
