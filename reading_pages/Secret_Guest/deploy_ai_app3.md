### Build Home Page

Every page in Streamlit has 2 components:
* The side bar on the left. 
  * Streamlit will automatically detect all of your web pages and list them on the side bar.
  * You can decide which elements to show on the side var, such as the logo, required user input, etc.
* The main web elements are on the right side.

The user interface for Local Stream is straightforward. Users need to input their destination country and the month of their intended travel. Additionally, they can further specify the particular region within the country they wish to visit.

Now let's break down the code of this home page to learn how to use Streamlit.

* Line 4 specifies page title, which will be shown in the tab of user's browser.
* Line 5 ~ 7 shows how can we add elements in sidebar. The code here is adding the logo image there.
* Line 13 ~ 15 is trying to set the default value of "show_region", you will see this web element below. This settings means, by default, the user won't specify the traveling region. What's important to highlight here is `st.session_state`. The session state stores all variables that can be shared within a user session, meaning these variables can be accessed across different pages of the app, and their values remain consistent between reruns of a user session.
