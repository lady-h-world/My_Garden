Under the silver glow of the moon, he returns to the garden. Butterflies, dancing around his magnetic presence in a graceful choreography, their wings sparkling with golden hues, adding an extra layer of enchantment to the scene. Each step he takes stirs the air, releasing the sweet fragrance of the blooming flowers that responded to his presence. His name is Hanashiro, the ruler of Planet Onxy. 

Locating in the depth of dark side of the universe, where shadows and mysteries interwined, Onxy renowned for its formidable cutting-edge dark technology. As the owner of this planet, Hanashiro's power is as diverse as the stars that adored the night sky, countless tales about him hold sway over the fears and respect of planets scattered throughout the cosmos. Golden Butterfly Storm, a breathtaking display of both beauty and danger, is Hanashiro's iconic weapon. The once tranquil and elegant butterflies transform into razor-sharp blades in the blink of an eye, capable of slicing through the hardest and the mightiest creatures. In addition, he is a repository of knowledge, from the histories of lost civilizations to the secrets of the cosmos, Hanashiro holds the keys to a vast trove of understanding.

We never glimpsed his true appearance as he constantly alters his looks. Some speculate he's Lady H.'s husband, while others believe he's her older brother. Regardless of the narrative woven, the undeniable truth lies in their profound closeness. As steadfast companions, they are bound by threads of shared hobbies and unspoken understandings, and wherever Lady H. embarks her adventure, Hanashiro is with her.

Hanashiro's golden butterflies are nurtured in our garden, the vibrant blooms and delicate foliage create an idyllic haven for these lovely creatures. Infused with a touch of Hanashiro's power, each butterfly carries a trace of his magic. As they're dancing around in this botanical wonderland, some of our sprouts have absorbed a bit of Hanashiro's magic as well.

Let's see, what kind of power you can gain here!

ðŸŒ± You can draw butterfly and butterfly storms with the power of [mathematics and statistic >>][2].

ðŸŒ± Much like Hanashiro's power to craft deceptive appearances, data science also holds the ability to [generate counterfeits using GANs >>][3] (generative adversarial networks).

ðŸŒ± To be as knowledgeable as Hanashiro, you can get the latest knowledge from the power of web mining.

Let's go and collect the sprouts now!
