On the 10th night of every month, he comes to the garden, that magnetic presence is always accompanied by soft fluttering of delicate wings. Butterflies, dancing around him in a graceful choreography. Their wings sparkled with golden colors, adding a layer of enchantment to the scene. Each step he takes stirs the air, releasing the sweet fragrance of the blooming flowers that responded to his presence.

He's Lady H.'s best friend, we only know his name is Hanashiro and never saw his real look since he often changes appearance.
