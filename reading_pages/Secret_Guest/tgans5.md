### Generate Tabular Synthetic Data

#### About the Data

If you have already visited [Resplendent Tree][2], you must be familiar with our Garden Bank and its [deposit campaign data][1].

Our Garden Bank is famous for its safety, attracting significant investments and deposits from the outside world. To safeguard customers' data, we employed a strategy to confuse hackers by interspersing real and fake data locations. Each genuine data piece has multiple look-alike fake data pieces stored in various locations, making it challenging for hackers to pinpoint the actual location of each set of real data.

Synthetic data generation is one of the solutions to make this strategy come true!

The experiments you're going to see are using deposit campaign data again. Let's take look at the snapshot of the real data and the generated synthetic data:

#### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of generated synthetic data, Lady H. employed 2 methods.

First evaluation method was to compare variables' distributions between real data and synthetic data. PSI score was used to compare continuous variable's distribution and JS Distance was used to compare discrete variable's distribution.

PSI often employees these thresholds:
* `PSI < 0.1`: no significant distribution change
* `0.1 <= PSI < 0.2`: moderate distribution change
* `PSI >= 0.2`: significant distribution change

So, if we can find more variables have PSI score lower than 0.2 or even lower than 0.1, then the generated synthetic data is more similar to the real data.

JS Distance (or JS Divergence) can be used to compare discrete variable's distributions, it's a score between `[0, 1]`, "0" corresponds to identical distributions and "1" to absolutely different. Lady H. was using "0.1" as the threshold, if more variables got JS Distance lower than 0.1, then the generated synthetic data is more similar to the real data.
