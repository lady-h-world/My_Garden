If you have already visited [Resplendent Tree][2], you must be familiar with our Garden Bank and its [deposit campaign data][1].

Our bank is famous for its safety, attracting significant investments and deposits from the outside of the world. To safeguard customers' data, we employed a strategy to confuse hackers by interspersing real and fake data locations. Each genuine data piece has multiple look-alike fake data pieces stored in various locations, making it challenging for hackers to pinpoint the actual location of each set of real data.

Synthetic data generation is one of the solutions to make this strategy come true!
