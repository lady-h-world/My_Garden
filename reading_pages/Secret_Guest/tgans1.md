## Generate Tabular Synthetic Data with TGANs

### About GANs

Generative Adversarial Network, commonly known as "GAN", is gaining increasing popularity on the Earth. They have been applied across a wide range of fields, including music generation, style transfer in paintings, the creation of realistic gaming environments, virtual try-ons in the fashion industry, deepfakes, poem writing, and more.

While GANs have found extensive use in manipulating image and text data, a question arises: can they be effectively applied to tabular data? In the stop, we will explore the generation of synthetic tabular data through TGANs (Tabular GANs). Before delving into this, let's gain a brief understanding of how GANs operate.
