## Have Fun with Math & Statistics

Have you ever seen this side of the mathematics world where numbers don't just add up, they dance, they twirl and they even flutter! This is a butterfly brought to life by formulas, and it has a beautiful name, "butterfly curve".

The function is simple:

It was discovered by a mathematician in 1989, and later more mathematicians found the function's variants where leaves, flowers or other insects became apparent. Wondering why such studies had been done? ðŸ˜‰ For fun, of course! ðŸ˜„

<p>&nbsp;</p>

And guess what's more fun! If we just change butterfly curve function from cartesian coordinate system to polar coordinate system, now you're seeing the shape same as Hanashiro's golden butterfly storm!

Cartesian coordinate uses (x, y) coordinate system to specify points in a plane. Polar coordinate uses distance `r` and angle `Î¸` to specify points. A general form of polar equation is `r = f(Î¸)`, which determines how does distance r depend on the angle Î¸. Butterfly curve's polar equation looks like:

In python code, polar coordinate is considered as a type of projection called `polar` projection. We can change to `lambert` projection to view butterfly curve from another perspective. Isn't it beautiful?
