Have you ever seen this part of the mathematics world where numbers don't just add up, they dance, they twirl and they even flutter! This is a butterfly brought to life by formulas, and it has a beautiful name, "butterfly curve".

The function is simple:

It was discovered by a mathematician in 1989, and later more mathematicians found the function's variants where leaves, flowers or other insects became apparent. Wondering why such studies had been done? ðŸ˜‰ For fun, of course! ðŸ˜„

<p>&nbsp;</p>

And guess what's more fun! If we just change butterfly curve function from cartesian coordinate system to polar coordinate system, now you're seeing the shape same as Hanashiro's golden butterfly storm!

Cartesian coordinate uses (x, y) coordinate system to specify points in a plane, while polar coordinate uses distance `r` and angle `Î¸` to specify points. A general form of polar equation is `r = f(Î¸)`, which determines how does distance r depend on the angle Î¸. Butterfly curve's polar equation looks like:

In python code, polar coordinate is considered as a type of projection called `polar` projection. We can change to `lambert` projection to view butterfly curve from another perspective. Isn't it beautiful?

### Butterfly Dances

Now let's borrow some magic from distributions, to make the butterflies dance! Look!

The shape of "beta dance" was using beta distribution, and the shape of "logistic dance" was using logistic distribution.

To make butterfly dances come true, let's understand the differences between pdf and cdf. The cdf (cumulative distribution function) is the probability that random variable values less than or equal to `x` whereas the pdf (probability density function) is a probability that a random variable will take a value exactly equal to `x`. Often times, when we plot the distribution curve, we use pdf.

The butterfly dances are plotted with cdf, intervalled cdf. The curves below plots the pdf and cdf for beta distribution and logistic distribution. The left side smooth curves are pdfs with different parameter settings and intervalled cdfs are the right side plots formed by blue stars.

With these intervalled cdf, you just need to replace the blue stars with butterflies. You can choose not to connect butterflies together, Lady H. chose to link them together so that you can see the shape of the dances clearly.
