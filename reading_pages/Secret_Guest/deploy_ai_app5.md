### Build Results Page

The code below has the key logic of recommendation generation and map display.
* `get_llm_suggests()` uses OpenAI to suggest traveling locations in your destination and local activities in each location.
* `get_geo_json()` uses Nominatim, a geocoding software to find the latitude and longitude of each suggested location.
* `get_map()` will create a map based on locations' latitude and longitude, then Streamlit built-in `pydeck_chart()` will display the map.

The code below shows the implementation of the 3 functions highlighted above, they are implemented in `utils.py`.
* In `get_llm_suggests()`:
  * Model was using GPT-3.5 Turbo, you can choose more advanced models [here][3].
  * `messages` creates the query that searches for best activities to do in user specified region & country & month, as well as listing all those activity locations.
  * It returns suggested location list and detailed suggestions separately.
* If suggested location list is not empty, `get_geo_json()` generates geo information using Nominatim service:
  * In order to use Nominatim, you have to specify User-Agent header to identify yourself, this helps the service track usage and enforce usage policies. Since its main purpose is to identify the user, your can use your email address as the value of `User-Agent`.
    * In the code below, Lady H.'s header was saved in Streamlit secrets `st.secrets['PYDECK_UA']` in order to keep it private. You will see details in later deployment section.
  * The geo information can be generated from this type of url `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/?addressdetails=1&q={dest}+{region}+{country}&format=json&limit=1`, it only needs to fill in the `dest`, `region` and `country`.
  * Its output is a pandas dataframe that stores each suggested location (`dest`), together with its latitude and longitude.
* `get_map()` loads the output of `get_geo_json()`, with known latitude and longitude of each location, it creates a map using `pydeck`.

After loading the map, if the suggestion is not empty, then it's time to show photos of the suggested local activities. For this app, Lady H. prefers to do up-to-date photo search, so that users can feel better about what's happening in the local recently. That's also why the app is called as "Local Stream". Considering price, image search quality and speed, Lady H. found 2 available solutions:
* Apify enabled image search
* Google Custom Search enabled image search

As shown in the code below, the main difference between these 2 approaches is, Apify execute all the image search queries before loading any image while Google Custom Search executes a query and load its images before executing the next query. This is because Apify's image search is slower, executing all the queries ahead of time can cut its total image search and loading time in half.

Meanwhile, as you can see, Google Custom Search solution is only used when the Apify solution is not runnable. Lady H. did this arrangement is because Apify's image search generates much higher quality and more relevant photos, but it only offers $5 free credit per month, sometimes, Lady H. could use up all these credits before its getting renewed. So when Apify is not available, Google Custom Search comes to help, it allows 100 free queries daily and can get results fast. To narrow down google search results, you can apply [the filters here][4] in the query, but it's always challenging to get high quality or relevant image output.

The `search_images()` implemented in `utils.py` is showing all the filters Lady H. used on Google Custom Search.

That's it! That's all the work you need to do in order to develop such an AI powered app. Time to deploy it to make it available to the public!
