#### Experiments

The experiment results are summarized in table 5.1. To do the experiments,
* Each TGAN generates "synthetic" training data, which shares the same number of records as the "real" training data.
* Every ensembling model was trained using "synthetic" training data and subsequently tested on the "real" testing data. Its performance was then compared with that of the model trained on the "real" training data.
