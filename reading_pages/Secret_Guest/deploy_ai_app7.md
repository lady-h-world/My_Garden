Local Stream is a simple app, but before achieving this result, Lady H. went through three failed versions due to issues with user experience. The key to building a successful product is not just ensuring model performance but also maintaining a good balance between smooth user experience and satisfying model performance. If either factor is lacking, users won't use your app.

At first, Lady H. intended to utilize Instagram to showcase local activities due to its collection of fun photos taken by ordinary people in various travel destinations. These photos are up-to-date and available for free. In an effort to search for the most relevant photos on Instagram, Lady H. experimented with sentiment analysis and different ranking formulas. However, Instagram has strong security settings, once it detected bot-like activities, it prompts additional manual authentication steps. Lady H. couldn't find a way to automatically bypass these authentication requests, so she had to explore alternative solutions for image search.

Here are the examples of image search using Instagram:

It's unfortunate not being able to use Instagram photos. However, every cloud has a silver lining! Lady H. later discovered that the image search results provided by Apify Image Scraper or Google Custom Search are both more relevant and specific compared to Instagram. Additionally, to achieve the desired user experience, Lady H. experimented through trial and error to find ways to ensure image search quality while reducing image search and loading times.

Initially, OpenAI wasn't the first choice for providing travel suggestions. Lady H. experimented with web scraping to extract recommendations from popular travel websites and also tried renowned tools like [Langchain][1]. However, after weighing factors such as output quality, user experience, and financial cost, Lady H. ultimately decided to use the OpenAI API.

Building a product offers numerous learning opportunities. Lady H. wonders if her personality belongs to a minority group that cannot stop thinking about better solutions until a satisfying one is found. How about you? [Share your product development stories here!][4]

Also, keep in mind, friends, that sometimes you need to take a good rest first. After returning to work, you may find that you have even better ideas!
