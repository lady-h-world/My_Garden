Sometimes Lady H. landed on a planet where cameras can't be used at all, in order to visually record the amazing scenes she saw, she applies math & distributions too!

This is a perfect example when Lady H. landed on a planet called "Rusthaven", where everything here is in rusty red and the sky kept dropping rusty rain. She walked around, trying to find a restaurant (in fact she's not hungary at all, just wanted to see what does the food look like there), suddenly she noticed a white rose in full bloom on the ground, its vivid white hue stood out dramatically against the backdrop. Why this rose wasn't dyed into rusty red? Ahhh, there's a transparent "umbrella" above the rose! In fact, it's an umbrella formed by this rose itself! What an amazing nature.
