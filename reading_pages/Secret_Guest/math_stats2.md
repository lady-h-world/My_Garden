Sometimes Lady H. landed on a planet where cameras can't be used at all, in order to visually record the amazing scenes she saw, she applies math & distributions too!

This is a perfect example when Lady H. landed on a planet called "Rusthaven", where everything here is in rusty red and the sky kept dropping rusty rain. She walked around, trying to find a restaurant (in fact she's not hungary at all, just wanted to see what does the food look like there ðŸ˜‰), suddenly she noticed a white rose in full bloom on the ground, its vivid white hue stood out dramatically against the backdrop. Why this rose wasn't dyed into rusty red? Ahhh, there's a transparent "umbrella" above the rose! In fact, it's an umbrella formed by this rose itself! What an amazing nature.

To draw this scene, the method is similar to golden butterflies. You can draw a rose using rose curve, the rusty rain is formed by distribution curves, and in this case, Lady H. was using the pdf of gamma distributions, the umbrella can use 2 linear lines.
