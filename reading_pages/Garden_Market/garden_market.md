Running this garden requires a substantial budget. Expenses include caring for the treasures, spending on garden decoration and maintenance, employee salaries, and investments in new technologies, all of which entail significant financial commitments.

To maintain financial stability, Lady H. established a market within the garden to produce perfumes crafted from our plants and sold them to the broader universe. Due to their unique fragrances, fashionable designs, and exceptional client services, "Lady H." has evolved into a renowned perfume brand. Individuals from diverse backgrounds take pride in owning a bottle of "Lady H." perfume.

The perfume-making process is automated, and our garden market has even developed two manufacturing pipelines to produce perfumes.

## Garden Market's Pipelines
### Personalized Perfume Pipeline

This pipeline exclusively produces customized perfumes for a few selected clients. Interested individuals are invited to share a story, whether real or fictional. If Lady H. likes the story, the client receives a personally designed perfume for free. The selection of clients entirely relies on Lady H.'s preferences ðŸ˜‰. Through this approach, Lady H. can maintain her passion for perfume design without the constraints from money.

In order to make a personalized perfume, we will send a specialist to gather the client's preferences, personality traits, and life stories. Based on this information, we design a customized product that best suits the customer.


### Mass Production Pipeline

While the personalized perfume pipeline exclusively caters to a selected group of clients, our mass production pipeline is designed for the general population. It produces a diverse range of perfumes to accommodate a broad spectrum of public preferences. Through this pipeline, each type of perfume can be manufactured in large batches to meet the demands. The manufacturing process is entirely automated, spanning from the harvesting of plants to ingredient preprocessing, perfume production, and concluding with product quality checks, all of which are carried out by robots.
