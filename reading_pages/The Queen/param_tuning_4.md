### Experiment 2 - Optimization with Specified Search Space

After experimenting on defualt settings, now it's time to make the improvement, and a straightforward way is to specify a better search space, meaning, to suggest a better value range for hyperparameters. In this experiment, Lady H. was focusing on classifying 30-class leaves.

#### FLAML Specified Search Space

To specify the search space in FLAML, no matter whether the model is in FLAML's default estimator list, users need to create a new class with specified hyperparameters. For example, Lady H. wanted to adjust the hyperparameters of LGBM, and she had to create a new learner class like this:

</p>

To specify a good search space, different models have different tips. Hyperparameters can be adjusted for better accuracy, or for faster speed, or for reducing overfitting, etc.

After creating the new learner class, users just need to add it to the `estimator_list` and to the AutoML instance:

In the code, you will also see, Lady H. had tried CFO and Blend Search again with larger search space, but neither worked well. Lessons learned, `larger search space != better search space`


#### Optuna Specified Search Space

Same as Experiment 1, in Optuna, to specify a search space, users also need to create an objective function. Meanwhile, in order to apply cross validation as the above FLAML experiment, `LightGBMTunerCV()` was used here:

<p align="left">

</p>

The Optuna experiment took much longer running time than FLAML, therefore, Lady H. was wondering whether she should add pruning to skip those unpromising trials in order to save time, it might also reduce the overfitting. TPE was still used as the search strategy in Optuna experiments. In order to achieve a better performance result, [hyperband is a suggested pruner to be used together with TPE][3]. What's more, because the testing performance from above Optuna experiment didn't look well, Lady H. added more trials to see whether there can be some performance improvement.

</p>

In these experiments, FLAML and Optuna share the same specified search space. However, comparing with their default settings, FLAML made 11.87% improvement in testing performance without increasing the time cost, while Optuna had 8% decrease in the testing performance and increased its time cost by 3 times.

</p>

<i>NOTE: the time cost of Optuna experiments were using 10 trials' time in Table1.5.</i>

Looking into Optuna's experiment code, you may have noticed that the time cost increased 9 times when the number of trials increased 9 times. However, this won't happen in FLAML, because FLAML's time complexity is affected by the number of hyperparameters rather than the number of trials.

</p>

The output of Optuna experiments didn't show prunning had happened at all. This made Lady H. wonder, was it because Optuna's pruner doesn't work well with cross validation? And how to make optuna's pruner work? She decided to test more in the next experiment.
