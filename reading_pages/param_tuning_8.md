Have you ever wonder where do we store so many sprouts for garden visitors? We have a giant green warehouse, which contains hundreds of green houses to grow sprouts! In order to maintain a healthy growing environment, every green house is monitored all the time. One of the monitoring metrics is "occupancy", by checking the temperature, humidity, light, CO2 and humidity ratio, we can forecast whether a green house has enough space for new sprouts.
