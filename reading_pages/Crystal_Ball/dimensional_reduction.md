## Dimensional Reduction

When we try to visualize the data, each column is considered as a dimension. For example, 2 dimensional data can be ploted on x-axis and y-axis, 3 dimensional data can be ploted on x-axis, y-axis and z-axis.

To plot the data into axis space is a straightforward way to understand the data. However, for data with more than 3 dimensions, such plot is challenging. By leveraging the power of the crystal ball, Lady H. can project higher dimensional data into lower dimensions while trying to keep the data structure within the data. This power is called as "Dimensional Reduction".
