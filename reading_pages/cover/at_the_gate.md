See that lotus blooming in the snow? You will know more about her and her magic very soon! This garden is full of exotic plants that you never saw before. They have unique characteristics as well as super power that's being called as "Data Science" in the outside world. 
  
Lady H. travels a lot and collected these plants. As a typical explorer, she had done lots of experiments to test on different super power. Throughout this tour, we will show you the plants, their magic and Lady H.'s experiments. At each stop, you can collect the sprouts of each plant, taking them home and spread the sprouts in the outside world.
  
Although these sprouts can't make existing problems in your world disappear immediately, they will bring you the mind of curiosity and exploration, practical skills and confidence in data science, the passion of problem solving, the inner peace and the magic in your future life!

Line up, let's start the tour now!
