* [Predictive Power Score][5] 
  * Besides the [Granger Causality you have seen here][6], later Lady H. learned [PPS (Predictive Power Score)][7], a method detects asymmetric correlation might also be helpful in telling "assumed causality". It helps finding which variable helps predict another dependent/independent variable better.

### Time Series
* [AutoTS][1]
  * AutoML for Time Series 
* [Darts][2]
  * Time Series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection

### Hyperparameter Tuning (HPO)
* [Ray Tune][4]
  * An HPO tool built upon Ray project to speed up HPO work, and has integrated many popular libraries, such as Optuna, FLAML, Keras, Scikit-learn, XgBoost, etc.

### Model Monitoring
* [Predict MAE or MSE of Regression Model][3]
