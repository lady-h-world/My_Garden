You must have seen the Chinese poem [at the beginning of this tour][1]! "朝露珠纱润花枝， 月华蝶舞耀星辰。" Lady H. wrote it to depict the daily views in the garden. Born as a Chinese, it is natural for her to illustrate the beautiful scenery with beautiful Chinese characters.

"朝露珠纱润花枝" is the morning view in the garden. When morning dew came out, it moisturized the flowers and the spider web, like covering them with liquid silk, everything looks so fresh. "月华蝶舞耀星辰" is the night view of the garden. Shining silver butterflies dances under the moonlight, the light shed by these little creatures look like the stars in the sky.
