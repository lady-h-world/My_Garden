This is a collection from a planet called "Power".

The ground of this planet is covered by flowers, each possessing the ability to fly. The destination of these flying flowers is the cloud in the sky. However, the number of clouds is significantly limited, far fewer than the multitude of flowers. Some flowers spent their whole life and couldn't find a cloud, some flowers reached a cloud and even ascended to a higher one, some flowers fell from the cloud and died ugly, some flowers created new clouds......

This collection was a flower who found its cloud. After taking this position, it gained the ability to influence the flight paths of certain flying flowers. It perceives itself as the sun, expecting unanimous agreement from the flying flowers. It favors those flowers that consistently align with its views, elevating them, and will blow down the flower who expressed disagreement. What he doesn't know is, the real nutrition to keep him healthy on this cloud is true words and real opinions. Unfortunately, all the flying flowers decided to keep quiet in case to be blown down to a cave called, "Isolation". 

Over the time, it began emitting a foul odor, dispersing a noxious stench reminiscent of decaying flesh. Additionally, it released toxic droplets to the ground, causing any flowers touched by these droplets to decay too.

The name of this flower, is "Suppression".
