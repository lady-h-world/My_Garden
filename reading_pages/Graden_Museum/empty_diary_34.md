This diary used to sit in the rose garden, whenever something gave Lady H. a headache, she wrote it down here to find peace. This is a book recorded stories made her angry, regret or sad. But started from page 34, it's all blank.

It started when she lost patience to her 80-year-old dad and said blaming words, even though she knew he wouldn't mind, the apologetic feeling still occupied her mind, rather than writing anything down, she apologized to dad. 

When she often had to repeatedly explain the same thing to some junior coworkers and still got disappointed, thinking they're stupid, rather than writing anything down, she asked ChatGPT and learned these people have different cognitive system, she changed the way to communicate and manage them, even took courses to improve her management on this type employees. 

All these efforts made her and people around feel better. When Lady H. found this diary again, it's been a while after her last writing. She held it for some time, memories came to her mind, she smiled and put it in the museum.
