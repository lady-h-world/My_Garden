## Stories Behind the Poker Cards

Every poker card featured in each chapter was designed by Lady H. Designing is one of her hobbies, though sheâ€™s not very skilled at drawing. At first, she sketched out the initial designs and planned to hire a professional artist to refine them. However, it wasnâ€™t long before OpenAI developed the ability to create high-quality illustrations quickly and for free. As a result, most of the cards you see were brought to life by OpenAI, based on Lady H.'s ideas. At the same time, Lady H. wants to keep her own sketches, as creating them was a joyful experience ðŸ˜„. Below, you can compare Lady H.'s original drawings (on the left) with OpenAI's results.

### Lotus Queen
This was Lady H.'s very first poker card, in fact she loved it, but AI did a much better job.

### Resplendent Tree
Lady H. uses the Resplendent Tree to convey her anger toward discrimination in the real world and her hopes for equality and unity among humanity. With the help of AI, she has incorporated the Tower of Babel into the picture as a cautionary symbol.
