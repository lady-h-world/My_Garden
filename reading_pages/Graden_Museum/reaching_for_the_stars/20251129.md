## Living in Two Worlds

Need to find a way to express myself, otherwise living this double life is driving me crazy.

During the day, I work at a large bank, leading AI innovation. Beyond the technical work, I constantly have to navigate office politics, such as strategically avoiding disagreeing with my manager in public meetings, choosing every word carefully because insecure people can easily slow things down, and managing dynamics that drain my energy. I’m tired of all of it, and deep down, I don’t want to work for anyone anymore.

After work, switch to my startup world. It’s still early stage, started from this October. It took me so long to find an idea with real potential, something meaningful where I can apply all my skills to solve real problems and make a bigger social impact. It also took years to find a co-founder I can genuinely collaborate with. We debate a lot; sometimes I lose patience internally, but I know she cares as much as I do, and communication is essential.

Our MVP is almost done, but we haven’t tested it with real users yet. My co-founder is afraid to reach out and sell the product, and she struggles with strategic communication. So I’m doing all the technical work and a lot beyond that. I’m also trying hard to update our application to Techstars. The competition is fierce, and I’m not sure if we’ll be lucky enough to get selected. If not, the road ahead will be much longer. And I can’t quit my full-time job until the product reaches a certain scale. So for now, I’m living these two lives, and not sure how long this will last for.

Sometimes I feel incredibly lonely, can’t let my colleagues know what I’m working on after hours. It’s also hard to find people in the same situation. There were moments when I suddenly fall into self-doubt or uncertainties, but in the end, still choose to focus on now and keep going.
