## Time to Move

Last night, spent whole night to apply for NEXT AI, also watched Techstars Boston Demo Day. In fact, my progress in past 2 months at nights and weekends was good, releasing MVP1 to app stores, having clear roadmap for user growth and monetization. Renee is a diligent and reliable collaborator, but her family reality won't allow her to work with me for a longer time. Need to find co-founders who are the better fit in this long term battle.

I don't plan to all-in to build my startup, cuz that type of pressure will kill my creativity and may not deliver better results. The best way I work is to have a full time job, building and networking in leisure time. I should go to San Francisco. Find a full time job in AI domain first, cuz SF is so expensive. Then networking to find potential co-founders while keep building.

Having thought about this plan for a while, now I have made the decision. Last night called my parents, they started to support this plan too.
All what I want, is to apply AIML in real problems, being surrounded by friends who share the same passion, together we build and make bigger social impact.
Going to use the rest of my vacations this year in Dec. end, to update resumes, to find a good place to live in SF, and start to sell furnitures. Then, quit the job, move to SF to find a full-time job first.
